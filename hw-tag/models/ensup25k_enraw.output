_OOV_/` of/I all/D their/F _OOV_/F ,/, special/J provisions/N ,/, and/C other/J _OOV_/$ and/C _OOV_/- ,/, insurance/N policies/N can/M still/R be/V _OOV_/R under/I two/C broad/J categories/N :/: so-called/J _OOV_/J insurance/N ,/, which/W _OOV_/V no/D cash/N value/N in/I the/D policy/N and/C _OOV_/N off/I only/R upon/I death/N ,/, and/C _OOV_/J insurance/N ,/, which/W provides/V not/R only/R a/D death/N _OOV_/, but/C also/R a/D cash/N value/N in/I the/D policy/N that/W can/M be/V used/V in/I various/J ways/N while/I the/D insured/V is/V still/R _OOV_/R ./.
If/I all/P you/M want/V is/V _OOV_/D coverage/N ,/, _OOV_/D insurance/N --/: a/D term/N policy/N --/: gives/V you/P maximum/N _OOV_/, for/I your/P _OOV_/N ,/, within/I _OOV_/N ./.
It/P 's/V much/R _OOV_/V than/I _OOV_/D insurance/N bought/V at/I the/D same/J age/N ./.
But/C ``/` term/N ''/' _OOV_/: just/R that/I ;/: the/D policy/N is/V written/V for/I a/D specific/J time/N period/N only/R and/C must/M be/V renewed/V when/W it/P _OOV_/N ./.
It/P may/M also/R _OOV_/V that/I the/D insured/V must/M pass/V another/D medical/J _OOV_/N before/I _OOV_/N ;/: if/I you/P _OOV_/V --/: which/W _OOV_/V you/P need/V insurance/N more/R than/I ever/R --/: you/P may/M not/R be/V able/J to/T buy/V it/P ./.
Even/R if/I you/P 're/V healthy/J and/C can/M _OOV_/R ,/, your/P premium/N will/M go/V up/I sharply/R because/I you/P 're/V that/I much/R older/J ./.
So/I term/N insurance/N may/M not/R be/V as/I cheap/J as/I it/P looks/V ./.
There/E are/V all/D _OOV_/N of/I _OOV_/N on/I term/N insurance/N :/: policies/N _OOV_/V to/T pay/V off/I your/P mortgage/N debt/N ,/, term/N _OOV_/M _OOV_/V on/I to/T _OOV_/D insurance/N ,/, and/C many/J others/N ./.

_OOV_/E goes/V to/T show/V that/I the/D First/N _OOV_/M applies/V in/I insurance/N as/I in/I anything/N else/R :/: There/E is/V no/D free/J _OOV_/N ,/, there/E is/V only/J marketing/N ./.

The/D _OOV_/N is/V that/I your/P _OOV_/J policy/N is/V really/R some/D kind/N of/I CD/N or/C _OOV_/J account/N with/I an/D added/V _OOV_/R ./.
That/D is/V _OOV_/I the/D _OOV_/N ./.
The/D fact/N is/V that/I as/I a/D _OOV_/# or/C investment/N _OOV_/N ,/, insurance/N generally/R runs/V a/D poor/J second/J to/T any/D direct/J investment/N you/P might/M make/V in/I the/D same/J things/N the/D insurance/N company/N is/V _OOV_/` your/P money/N into/I ./.
That/D 's/V because/I you/P have/V to/T pay/V for/I the/D insurance/N portion/N of/I the/D policy/N and/C the/D effort/N _OOV_/V to/T sell/V and/C service/N the/D whole/J package/N ./.

But/C the/D percentage/N of/I your/P cash/N _OOV_/, that/W you/P can/M borrow/V _OOV_/T is/V very/R small/J ./.
I/P 'm/V not/R prepared/V in/I any/D case/N to/T put/V that/I much/J money/N into/I a/D policy/N immediately/R ,/, so/R I/P look/V into/I the/D broad/J category/N called/V _OOV_/D life/N ./.
