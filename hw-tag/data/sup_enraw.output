``/` There/E are/V virtually/R no/D new/J projects/N ,/, and/C that/W means/V no/D new/J business/N for/I us/P ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ./.
Even/R when/W new/J lending/N resumes/N ,/, foreign/J exchange/N would/M still/R be/V _OOV_/R because/I Beijing/N will/M likely/R try/V to/T rein/N in/I foreign/J borrowing/N ,/, which/W has/V grown/V between/I 30/C %/N and/C 40/C %/N in/I the/D past/J few/J years/N ./.
And/C foreign/J creditors/N are/V likely/R to/T be/V more/R cautious/J about/I extending/V new/J loans/N because/I China/N is/V _OOV_/I a/D peak/N _OOV_/I period/N as/I many/J loans/N start/V falling/V due/J in/I the/D next/J two/C to/T five/C years/N ./.
Another/D reason/N for/I the/D _OOV_/N of/I the/D trade/N problems/N is/V that/I Beijing/N has/V extended/V the/D current/J _OOV_/N on/I imports/N beyond/I the/D usual/J target/N of/I consumer/N products/N to/T include/V steel/N ,/, chemical/N _OOV_/: and/C plastics/N ./.

But/C the/D _OOV_/N also/R spawned/V rampant/J speculation/N and/C spiraling/V prices/N ./.
To/T stem/V speculation/N ,/, Beijing/N imposed/V ceiling/N prices/N that/W went/V into/I effect/N earlier/R this/D year/N ./.
Traders/N who/W had/V bought/V the/D goods/N at/I prices/N above/I the/D ceiling/N do/V n't/R want/V to/T take/V a/D loss/N on/I _OOV_/$ and/C are/V holding/V onto/I their/P stock/N ./.

In/I the/D meantime/N ,/, the/D question/N faced/V by/I investors/N is/V :/: What/W is/V UAL/N stock/N worth/N ?/.
The/D short/J answer/N ,/, on/I a/D fundamental/J basis/N ,/, is/V that/I airline/N analysts/N say/V the/D stock/N is/V worth/J _OOV_/N between/I $/$ 135/C and/C $/$ 150/C a/D share/N ./.
That/I 's/P based/V on/I a/D multiple/N of/I anywhere/R between/I _OOV_/N to/T 10/C times/N UAL/N earnings/N ,/, which/W are/V estimated/V to/T come/V in/I _OOV_/N around/I $/$ 16/C a/D share/N this/D year/N ./.
_OOV_/L stocks/N typically/R sell/V at/I a/D discount/N of/I about/I one-third/N to/T the/D stock/N market/N 's/P _OOV_/J ratio/N --/: which/W is/V currently/R about/I 13/C times/N earnings/N ./.
That/D 's/V because/I airline/N earnings/N ,/, like/I those/D of/I auto/N makers/N ,/, have/V been/V subject/J to/T the/D cyclical/J _OOV_/N of/I the/D economy/N ./.
That/D analysis/N matches/V up/R with/I stock/N traders/N '/P reports/N that/I ,/, despite/I the/D huge/J drop/N in/I the/D stock/N ,/, UAL/N has/V n't/R returned/V to/T the/D level/N at/I which/W it/P could/M attract/V buying/V by/I institutions/N _OOV_/, on/I the/D basis/N of/I earnings/N ./.
So/I anyone/N buying/V the/D stock/N now/R is/V _OOV_/R on/I some/D special/J transaction/N such/J as/I a/D recapitalization/N or/C takeover/N ,/, and/C must/M do/V so/R using/V some/D _OOV_/N about/I the/D likelihood/N of/I such/J an/D event/N ./.

At/I that/D level/N ,/, and/C given/V the/D uncertainty/N ,/, he/P believes/V UAL/N stock/N should/M trade/V closer/R to/T
Other/J observers/N note/N that/I UAL/N 's/P board/N ,/, having/V accepted/V a/D bid/N of/I $/$ 300/C a/D share/N ,/, might/M hold/V out/R for/I a/D new/J bid/N much/R closer/R to/T the/D original/J level/N --/: even/R if/I it/P means/V that/I the/D management/N goes/V back/R to/T running/V the/D company/N for/I a/D while/I and/C lets/V things/N return/V to/T normal/J ./.

Although/I the/D _OOV_/J guideline/N was/V n't/R carried/V out/R in/I this/D month/N 's/P coup/N attempt/N ,/, some/D administration/N officials/N argue/V that/I it/P may/M have/V led/V to/T hesitation/N and/C uncertainty/N on/I the/D part/N of/I U.S./N intelligence/N and/C military/J _OOV_/N in/I Panama/N ./.

The/D issue/N came/V to/T a/D head/N last/J year/N ,/, officials/N recalled/V ,/, partly/R because/I the/D Reagan/N administration/N had/V sought/V unsuccessfully/R to/T win/V committee/N approval/N of/I funding/N for/I new/J Panama/N coup/N efforts/N ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, both/D administration/N and/C congressional/J officials/N said/V the/D need/N for/I guidelines/N on/I _OOV_/$ and/C assassinations/N was/V partly/R _OOV_/V by/I a/D White/N House/N desire/N to/T avoid/V nasty/J overseas/N _OOV_/, during/I the/D election/N campaign/N ./.

A/D labor-management/J group/N is/V preparing/V a/D revised/J buy-out/N bid/N for/I United/N Airlines/N parent/N UAL/N Corp./N that/W would/M transfer/V majority/N ownership/N to/T employees/N while/I leaving/V some/D stock/N in/I public/J hands/N ,/, according/V to/T people/N familiar/J with/I the/D group/N ./.
The/D group/N has/V been/V discussing/V a/D proposal/N valued/V in/I a/D range/N of/I $/$ 225/C to/T $/$ 240/C a/D share/N ,/, or/C $/$ _OOV_/C billion/C to/T $/$ _OOV_/C billion/C ./.

Instead/R ,/, the/D group/N is/V raising/V the/D proposal/N _OOV_/V to/T try/V to/T test/N the/D board/N 's/P reaction/N ./.
People/N familiar/J with/I the/D company/N say/V the/D board/N is/V n't/R likely/J to/T give/V quick/J approval/N to/T any/D offer/N substantially/R below/I the/D $/$ 300-a-share/J ,/, $/$ 6.79/C billion/C buy-out/N bid/N that/W collapsed/V last/J week/N after/I banks/N would/M n't/R raise/V needed/V loans/N and/C after/I a/D key/J partner/N ,/, British/J Airways/N PLC/N ,/, dropped/V out/R ./.

But/C the/D pilots/N union/N ,/, which/W has/V been/V pushing/V for/I a/D takeover/N since/I 1987/C ,/, appears/V to/T be/V pressing/V ahead/R with/I the/D revised/J bid/N to/T avoid/V further/J loss/N of/I momentum/N even/R though/I it/P has/V n't/R found/V a/D partner/N to/T replace/V British/J Air/N ./.
Although/I the/D bidding/N group/N has/V n't/R had/V time/N to/T develop/V its/P latest/J idea/N fully/R or/C to/T discuss/V it/P with/I banks/N ,/, it/P believes/V bank/N financing/N could/M be/V obtained/V ./.
After/I the/D collapse/N of/I the/D last/J effort/N ,/, the/D group/N does/V n't/R plan/V to/T make/V any/D formal/J proposal/N without/I _OOV_/D commitments/N from/I banks/N covering/V the/D _OOV_/J amount/N to/T be/V borrowed/V ./.
Under/I the/D type/N of/I transaction/N being/V _OOV_/U ,/, the/D _OOV_/J group/N would/M borrow/V several/J billion/C dollars/N from/I banks/N that/W could/M then/R be/V used/V to/T finance/V a/D cash/N payment/N to/T current/J holders/N ./.
Those/D current/J holders/N would/M also/R receive/V minority/N interests/N in/I the/D new/J company/N ./.

UAL/N currently/R has/V _OOV_/# million/C shares/N ,/, fully/R diluted/V ./.
The/D new/J structure/N would/M be/V similar/J to/T a/D recapitalization/N in/I which/W holders/N get/V a/D special/J dividend/N yet/R retain/V a/D controlling/V ownership/N interest/N ./.
The/D difference/N is/V that/I current/J holders/N would/M n't/R retain/V majority/N ownership/N or/C control/N ./.
The/D failed/J takeover/N would/M have/V given/V UAL/N employees/N 75/C %/N _OOV_/I control/N of/I the/D nation/N 's/P second-largest/J airline/N ,/, with/I management/N getting/V 10/C %/N control/N and/C British/J Air/N 15/C %/N ./.
It/P was/V n't/R clear/V how/W the/D ownership/N would/M _OOV_/V up/R under/I the/D new/J plan/N ,/, but/C employees/N would/M keep/V more/R than/I 50/C %/N ./.
Management/N 's/P total/N could/M be/V reduced/V ,/, and/C the/D public/N could/M get/V more/R than/I the/D 15/C %/N control/N that/W had/V been/V _OOV_/R for/I British/J Air/N ./.
One/C option/N the/D board/N is/V likely/R to/T consider/V today/N is/V some/D sort/N of/I _OOV_/D period/N ./.
Although/I the/D pilots/N are/V expected/V to/T continue/V to/T pursue/V the/D bid/N ,/, UAL/N Chairman/N Stephen/N Wolf/N may/M be/V asked/V to/T withdraw/V from/I the/D buy-out/N effort/N ,/, at/I least/J temporarily/R ,/, and/C to/T return/V to/T running/V the/D company/N full/J time/N ./.
The/D board/N could/M eventually/R come/V under/I some/D pressure/N to/T sell/V the/D company/N because/I its/P members/N can/M be/V ousted/V by/I a/D majority/N shareholder/N vote/N ,/, particularly/R since/I one-third/N of/I UAL/N stock/N is/V held/V by/I takeover/N stock/N speculators/N who/W favor/V a/D sale/N ./.
The/D labor-management/J buy-out/N group/N plans/V to/T keep/V its/P offer/N on/I the/D table/N in/I an/D apparent/J attempt/N to/T maintain/V its/P bargaining/N position/N with/I the/D board/N ./.

Mr./N Davis/N had/V paid/V $/$ 6/C million/C for/I _OOV_/` 's/P backing/V of/I his/P last/J bid/N ./.

On/I Friday/N ,/, British/J Air/N issued/V a/D statement/N saying/V it/P ``/` does/V not/R intend/V to/T _OOV_/V in/I any/D new/J deal/N for/I the/D acquisition/N of/I UAL/N in/I the/D foreseeable/J future/N ./. ''/'

One/P advantage/V the/D buy-out/N group/N intends/V to/T press/V with/I the/D board/N is/V that/I pilots/N have/V agreed/V to/T make/V $/$ 200/C million/C in/I annual/J cost/N concessions/N to/T help/V finance/V a/D bid/N ./.
_OOV_/L has/V also/R _OOV_/V that/I the/D UAL/N executive/N most/R closely/R identified/V with/I the/D failure/N to/T gain/V bank/N financing/N ,/, chief/J financial/J officer/N John/N Pope/N ,/, may/M come/V under/I pressure/N to/T resign/V ./.

If/I I/P die/V early/R ,/, I/P win/V --/: a/D _OOV_/J victory/N ,/, since/I I/P ca/M n't/R enjoy/V it/P --/: and/C if/I I/P live/V long/R ,/, the/D insurer/N _OOV_/- ./.
This/D is/V worth/J _OOV_/, when/W insurers/N and/C their/P salesmen/N try/V to/T sell/V you/P _OOV_/J insurance/N ,/, the/D kind/N that/I _OOV_/D cash/N value/N ./.
The/D word/N ``/` death/N ''/' can/M not/R be/V escaped/V entirely/R by/I the/D industry/N ,/, but/C salesmen/N _OOV_/W it/P _OOV_/V possible/J or/C _OOV_/` it/P in/I _OOV_/N ,/, _OOV_/U to/T talk/V about/I ``/` savings/N ''/' and/C ``/` investment/N ''/' instead/R ./.
The/D implication/N is/V that/I your/P _OOV_/J policy/N is/V really/R some/D kind/N of/I CD/N or/C mutual-fund/N account/N with/I an/D added/J _OOV_/N ./.
That/D is/V _OOV_/I the/D _OOV_/N ./.
The/D fact/N is/V that/I as/I a/D savings/N or/C investment/N vehicle/N ,/, insurance/N generally/R runs/V a/D poor/J second/J to/T any/D direct/J investment/N you/P might/M make/V in/I the/D same/J things/N the/D insurance/N company/N is/V putting/V your/P money/N into/I ./.
That/D 's/V because/I you/P have/V to/T pay/V for/I the/D insurance/N portion/N of/I the/D policy/N and/C the/D effort/N required/V to/T sell/V and/C service/N the/D whole/J package/N ./.
_OOV_/L ,/, no/D free/J lunch/N ./.
This/D is/V reflected/V in/I a/D _OOV_/J mortality/N cost/N --/: in/I effect/N ,/, your/P share/N of/I the/D company/N 's/P estimated/V liability/N in/I paying/V off/R _OOV_/V of/I people/N who/W had/V the/D _OOV_/J to/T die/V while/I under/I its/P protection/N ./.
And/C in/I most/J cases/N ,/, a/D huge/J _OOV_/N of/I your/P premium/N in/I the/D initial/J year/N or/C two/C of/I the/D the/D policy/N is/V ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, paying/V the/D salesman/N 's/P commission/N as/I well/R ;/: investment/N returns/N on/I most/J policies/N are/V actually/R negative/J for/I several/J years/N ,/, largely/R because/I of/I this/D ./.
So/R view/V _OOV_/D insurance/N for/I what/W it/P is/V --/: a/D _OOV_/N between/I _OOV_/D insurance/N and/C direct/J investment/N ./.
The/D _OOV_/N ,/, most/R traditional/J form/N of/I _OOV_/D insurance/N is/V the/D straight/J whole/J life/N policy/N ./.
You/P pay/V a/D set/N premium/N for/I a/D set/N amount/N of/I coverage/N ,/, the/D company/N _OOV_/I that/D premium/N in/I a/D portfolio/N of/I its/P choosing/V ,/, and/C your/P cash/N value/N and/C dividends/N grow/V over/I the/D years/N ./.
One/C newer/J wrinkle/N ,/, so/R called/V _OOV_/D life/N -LRB-/- you/P pay/V for/I the/D whole/J policy/N at/I once/R -RRB-/- ,/, has/V been/V _OOV_/D popular/J in/I recent/J years/N for/I tax/N reasons/N ;/: the/D insured/V could/M _OOV_/V cash/N value/N in/I the/D form/N of/I policy/N ``/` loans/N ,/, ''/' and/C none/N of/I the/D proceeds/N were/V _OOV_/R even/R though/I they/P included/V gains/N on/I investment/N ./.
Congress/N closed/V this/D _OOV_/J last/J year/N ,/, or/C thought/V it/P did/V ./.
However/R ,/, _OOV_/D Capital/N Corp./N of/I _OOV_/N ,/, Mass./N ,/, has/V developed/V a/D ``/` combination/N plan/N ''/' of/I annuity/N and/C insurance/N coverage/N that/I it/P says/V does/V not/R violate/V the/D new/J regulations/N and/C that/W allows/V policy/N loans/N without/I tax/N consequences/N ./.
But/C the/D percentage/N of/I your/P cash/N reserve/N that/I you/P can/M borrow/V _OOV_/T is/V very/R small/J ./.
I/P 'm/V not/R prepared/V in/I any/D case/N to/T put/V that/I much/J money/N into/I a/D policy/N immediately/R ,/, so/R I/P look/V into/I the/D broad/J category/N called/V _OOV_/D life/N ./.
_OOV_/` popular/J ,/, it/P is/V far/R more/J _OOV_/N than/I straight/J whole/J life/N ./.
I/P can/M adjust/V the/D amount/N of/I insurance/N I/P want/V against/I the/D amount/N going/V into/I investment/N ;/: I/P can/M pay/V more/R or/C less/J than/I the/D so-called/J target/N premium/N in/I a/D given/V year/N ;/: and/C I/P can/M even/R _OOV_/J payments/N if/I my/P cash/N reserves/N are/V enough/R to/T cover/V the/D insurance/N portion/N of/I the/D policy/N ./.
In/I looking/V at/I these/D and/C other/J policies/N ,/, I/P learn/V to/T ask/V pointed/V questions/N about/I some/D of/I the/D _OOV_/N built/V into/I ``/` policy/N _OOV_/, ''/' --/: the/D _OOV_/N of/I numbers/N that/I show/N me/P the/D _OOV_/N of/I my/P cash/N values/V over/I the/D years/N ./.
They/P _OOV_/M give/V two/C scenarios/N :/: One/C is/V based/V on/I interest/N rates/N that/I the/D company/N guarantees/N -LRB-/- usually/R 4/C %/N to/T 4.5/C %/N -RRB-/- and/C the/D other/J on/I the/D rate/N it/P is/V currently/R getting/V on/I investment/N ,/, often/R _OOV_/J %/N or/C more/R ./.
_OOV_/` the/D latter/N over/I several/J decades/N ,/, I/P find/V my/P cash/N _OOV_/M is/V impressive/J --/: but/C can/M any/D high/J interest/N rate/N prevail/V for/I that/D long/J ?/.
Not/R likely/R ,/, I/P think/V ./.
Also/R ,/, some/D policy/N _OOV_/M assume/V that/I mortality/N costs/N will/M decline/V or/C that/I I/P will/M get/V some/D sort/N of/I dividend/N bonus/N after/I the/D _OOV_/J year/N ./.
These/D are/V not/R certain/J ,/, either/C ./.
Companies/N ``/` are/V n't/R comfortable/J playing/V these/D games/N ,/, but/C they/P realize/V they/P 're/V under/I pressure/N to/T make/V their/P policies/N look/V good/J ,/, ''/' says/V Timothy/N _OOV_/- ,/, an/D _OOV_/J consultant/N at/I _OOV_/N ,/, a/D unit/N of/I _OOV_/F _OOV_/F Co./N ,/, the/D big/J New/N York/N consulting/N firm/N ./.
Another/D factor/N to/T consider/V :/: Some/D of/I the/D companies/N currently/R earning/N very/R high/J yields/N are/V doing/V so/R through/I substantial/J investment/N in/I junk/N bonds/N ,/, and/C you/P know/V how/W nervous/J the/D market/N has/V been/V about/I those/D lately/R ./.
There/E are/V _OOV_/S _OOV_/: twists/V to/T _OOV_/D life/N ,/, and/C it/P pays/V to/T ask/V questions/N about/I all/D of/I them/P ./.
At/I a/D _OOV_/F _OOV_/F ,/, for/I example/N ,/, a/D friend/N boasts/V that/I she/P 'll/M only/R have/V to/T pay/V premiums/N on/I her/P John/N Hancock/N policy/N for/I seven/C years/N and/C that/I her/P death/N benefits/N will/M then/R be/V ``/` guaranteed/V ./. ''/'
I/P call/V her/P agent/N ,/, David/N _OOV_/- ./.
Yes/U ,/, he/P says/V ,/, premiums/N on/I such/J _OOV_/J coverage/N can/M be/V structured/V to/T ``/` _OOV_/F ''/' after/I a/D certain/J period/N --/: but/C usually/R only/R if/I interest/N rates/N stay/V high/R enough/R to/T generate/V sufficient/J cash/N to/T cover/V the/D annual/J cost/N of/I insurance/N protection/N ./.
If/I interest/N rates/N plunge/N ,/, the/D insurer/N may/M be/V _OOV_/R on/I my/P door/N ,/, asking/V for/I _OOV_/D premium/N payments/N to/T maintain/V the/D same/J amount/N of/I protection/N ./.
I/P do/V n't/R like/I the/D sound/N of/I that/D ./.
Some/D insurers/N have/V also/R started/V offering/V ``/` _OOV_/U bonuses/N ,/, ''/' such/J as/I extra/J dividends/N or/C a/D marginally/R higher/J interest/N yield/N ,/, if/I the/D policy/N is/V _OOV_/R for/I 10/C years/N ./.
But/C Glenn/N Daily/N ,/, a/D New/N York-based/J financial/J consultant/N ,/, warns/V that/I many/J of/I these/D bonuses/N are/V ``/` just/R fantasies/N ,/, ''/' because/I most/R are/V n't/R guaranteed/V by/I the/D companies/N ./.
And/C the/D _OOV_/N is/V so/R new/J ,/, he/P adds/V ,/, that/I no/D insurer/N has/V yet/R established/V a/D track/N record/N for/I actually/R making/V such/J payments/N ./.
_OOV_/F _OOV_/F provisions/N also/R merit/N a/D close/J _OOV_/N ./.

Some/D provisions/N would/M let/V me/P _OOV_/V a/D percentage/N of/I the/D policy/N 's/P face/N value/N to/T pay/V for/I long-term/J care/N such/P as/R _OOV_/V _OOV_/S ;/: others/N would/M allow/V payments/N for/I catastrophic/J _OOV_/$ and/C conditions/N such/J as/I cancer/N ,/, heart/N _OOV_/- ,/, _OOV_/D failure/N and/C _OOV_/` _OOV_/U ./.
But/C the/D catastrophic/J events/N for/I which/W the/D _OOV_/N can/M _OOV_/R are/V narrowly/R defined/V ,/, vary/V from/I policy/N to/T policy/N ,/, and/C generally/R permit/V use/V of/I only/R a/D small/J fraction/N of/I the/D face/N amount/N of/I insurance/N ./.
Also/R ,/, financial/J planners/N advising/V on/I insurance/N say/V that/I to/T their/P knowledge/N there/E has/V not/R yet/R been/V a/D tax/N ruling/V _OOV_/I these/D advance/N payments/N from/I taxes/N ./.
