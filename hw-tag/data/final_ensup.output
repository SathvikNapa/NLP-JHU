With/I the/D dust/N settling/V from/I the/D failed/J coup/N attempt/N in/I Panama/N ,/N one/C of/I the/D many/J lingering/V questions/N the/D Bush/N administration/N will/N ponder/V is/V this/D :/: Is/V the/D National/N Security/N Council/N staff/N big/J enough/N ,/N and/C does/V it/P have/V enough/N clout/N ,/N to/T do/V its/P job/N of/I coordinating/V foreign/J policy/N ?/.
President/N Bush/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N ,/N Lt./N Gen./N Brent/N Scowcroft/N ,/N came/V into/I office/N in/I January/N intent/N on/I making/N the/D NSC/N staff/N leaner/J and/C more/R disciplined/J than/I it/P had/V been/V during/I the/D Reagan/N administration/N ./N
Gen./N Scowcroft/N was/V a/D member/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/N which/W investigated/V the/D Iran-Contra/N affair/N ./N
He/P was/V all/D too/R aware/J of/I how/W a/D large/J ,/N inadequately/R supervised/J NSC/N staff/N had/V spun/V out/R of/I control/N and/C nearly/R wrecked/V President/N Reagan/N 's/P second/J term/N ./N
So/I ,/, following/N both/C the/D style/N he/P pursued/V as/I President/N Ford/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N and/C the/D recommendations/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/N Gen./N Scowcroft/N has/V pruned/V the/D NSC/N staff/N and/C tried/V to/T ensure/V that/I it/P sticks/V to/T its/P assigned/J tasks/N --/: namely/R ,/R gathering/V the/D views/N of/I the/D State/N Department/N ,/N Pentagon/N and/C intelligence/N community/N ;/: serving/V as/I an/D honest/J broker/N in/I distilling/V that/D information/N for/I the/D president/N and/C then/R making/V sure/R presidential/J decisions/N are/V carried/V out/I ./N
The/D Tower/N Commission/N specifically/R said/V that/I the/D NSC/N staff/N should/M be/V ``/` small/J ''/' and/C warned/V against/I letting/V ``/` energetic/J self-starters/N ''/' like/I Lt./N Col./N Oliver/N North/N strike/N out/R on/I their/P own/J rather/R than/I leaving/N the/D day-to-day/J execution/N of/I policies/N to/T the/D State/N Department/N ,/N Pentagon/N or/C Central/N Intelligence/N Agency/N ./N
However/R ,/` the/D Panama/N episode/N has/V raised/V questions/N about/I whether/I the/D NSC/N staff/N is/V sufficiently/R big/J ,/N diverse/J and/C powerful/J to/T coordinate/V U.S./N policy/N on/I tough/J issues/N ./N

The/D National/N Security/N Council/N itself/P was/V established/V in/I 1947/C because/I policy/N makers/N sensed/V a/D need/N ,/N in/I an/D increasingly/R complex/J world/N ,/N for/I a/D formal/J system/N within/I the/D White/N House/N to/T make/V sure/R that/D communications/N flowed/V smoothly/R between/I the/D president/N and/C the/D State/N Department/N ,/N Pentagon/N and/C intelligence/N agencies/N ./N
By/I law/N ,/` the/D council/N includes/V the/D president/N ,/N vice/N president/N and/C secretaries/N of/I state/N and/C defense/N ./N

But/C the/D size/N ,/N shape/N and/C role/N of/I the/D NSC/N staff/N have/V been/V left/V for/I each/D president/N and/C his/P national/J security/N adviser/N to/T decide/V ./N
